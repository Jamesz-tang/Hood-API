Optimize packages  for the list of items with weight, dimensions and a field representing
whether it is an assembled, another field representing whether it is a bundle item using google OR Tools.

Considering the given list of pallets, each has maximum height, fixed width and fixed length. Assembled items cannot
be stacked over another assembled item in the same pallet.
Each bundle item must be in a bundle and cannot have any other items.
Smaller pallets are preferred but not required.
 use the Bin Packing algorithm with additional constraints to ensure items are packed appropriately.
