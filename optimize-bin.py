# Optimize bins for the list of items with weight, dimensions and a field representing whether it is an assembled,
# another field representing whether it is a bundle item using google OR Tools.
#
# Considering the given list of pallet types, each has a type, maximum height, fixed width and fixed length as well as weight.
#
# Each pallet type can be used multiple times if needed. That is, it is assumed there are infinite pieces of pallets for each type.
# Items on the same pallet can be put side by side if there are rooms to fit.
# Assembled items cannot be stacked over another assembled item in the same pallet. Each bundle item must be in a bundle and cannot have any other items.
# The bin must provide actual height. Smaller pallets are preferred but not required. There are no constraints on the weight of a pallet.
#
# The assembled items must not be stacked on another assembled item on the same pallet. The solution must include actual height used and include the items details.
#
# Please output the total weight of each pallet/bin and the total number of pallets/bins used, and the deatls of the items on teh pallet, and the pallet details as well.

# Explanation:
# Data Model:
#
# Items and pallets are defined as lists of dictionaries with relevant attributes.
# Each pallet type includes a weight attribute.
# New Variables:
#
# x[i][j]: Binary variable indicating if item i is placed on pallet j.
# y[j]: Binary variable indicating if pallet j is used.
# z[j]: Continuous variable storing the actual height used in pallet j.
# total_weight[j]: Continuous variable storing the total weight of pallet j.
# Constraints:
#
# Each item must be placed on exactly one pallet.
# Respect the dimensions and constraints of each pallet.
# Sum of heights of items on a pallet should not exceed its max height.
# Total weight of each pallet is calculated including the pallet's own weight.
# Assembled items cannot be stacked on another assembled item in the same pallet.
# Bundle items must be placed alone in a pallet.
# Objective:
#
# Minimize the number of pallets used.
# Solution Output:
#
# Prints the type, actual height, and total weight of each pallet used.
# Details of items placed on each pallet.
# Total number of pallets/bins used.
